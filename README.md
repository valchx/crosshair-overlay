# This is a simple Crosshair overlay for FPS games.

I personaly use it for Arma Reforger to know where the general center of my screen is when not ADS-ing.

You may use it as you like.

Feel free to forking it or sending pull requests for improvements if you'd like.

If this does not work on your machine, try to fix it and send the fix.

I'm currently on Manjaro + KDE Plasma (X11) and it works fine.
